### Hey
I do stuff occasionally IDK

- I'm 18, and I program on occasion when I feel like it but I'm kinda really bad at it lol

- I usually make simple mods for games like Geometry Dash or Balatro

- I'm most familiar with Python and C/C++, but I have briefly ventured into other languages like JavaScript (ew), Lua, etc.

- I guess if you wanna contact me you can find me on Discord @ gdemerald
